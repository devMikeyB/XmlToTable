# XmlToTable
This is a tool for translating rotmg Xml files to a LUA table usable by Roblox.

 In its current state it is fairly limited and is intended to serve as a learning tool.

Run item_import.py and follow the cmd prompts. 
Dependencies will need to be manually installed via Pip3.

The test xml is the Additions.xml from Phoenix and only contains content added post-ninja
